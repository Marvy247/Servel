# Servel - Web3 DevInfra-as-a-Service Platform
## The "Vercel of Smart Contracts" - MVP Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Initial Setup
    - [x] Initialize project structure:
  - [x] `mkdir -p {backend,frontend,devops,contracts,scripts}`
  - [x] `npm init -y` (root)
  - [x] `npm init -y` (frontend)
  - [x] `forge init contracts` (Foundry setup)
  - [x] Environment variables:
  - [x] `.env` template with:
    - [x] SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
    - [x] SEPOLIA_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
    - [x] GITHUB_TOKEN (for CI/CD)
    - [x] ANVIL_PORT (default: 8545)
- [x] Tooling installation:
  - [x] Foundry (forge, anvil, cast)
  - [x] Slither
  - [x] Node.js + npm/yarn
  - [x] Docker

### üî® Backend Services
#### Deployment & Verification
- [x] Smart contract deployment service:
  - [x] Auto-detect contract artifacts in `contracts/out`
  - [x] Support for Sepolia & Anvil networks
  - [x] Automatic contract verification on Etherscan (Sepolia)
  - [x] Deployment status tracking

#### Analysis & Testing
  - [x] Static analysis integration:
  - [x] Slither runner with configurable rules
  - [x] Report generation in JSON/Markdown
  - [x] Batch contract analysis support
  - [x] Fuzzing/invariant testing:
  - [x] Foundry's built-in fuzzer (forge test --fuzz)
  - [x] Invariant testing with Foundry
  - [x] Test result visualization

#### Event Streaming
  - [x] Contract event listener service:
  - [x] WebSocket endpoint for real-time events
  - [x] Historical event query API
  - [x] Filtering by contract/event type

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Dashboard
- [x] Web3 provider implementation:
  - [x] Wallet connection (MetaMask) - implemented dropdown with disconnect
  - [x] Account/chain state management
  - [x] Network switching
  - [x] WalletDropdown component
- [x] Developer portal:
  - [x] Project overview (deployments, tests, analysis)
  - [x] Contract interaction playground
  - [x] Event log viewer
- [x] CI/CD status:
  - [x] GitHub Actions integration
  - [x] Test/analysis result visualization
  - [x] Deployment history
- [x] Network switcher (Sepolia/Anvil)

### üê≥ DevOps & Infrastructure
- [ ] Anvil automation:
  - Docker container for local development
  - Auto-restart on failure
  - Persistent state management
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline:
  - GitHub Actions workflows:
    - On-push testing
    - Scheduled fuzzing
    - Deployment verification
- [ ] Monitoring:
  - Anvil node health checks
  - Sepolia RPC monitoring

### üöÄ Final Polishing
- [ ] Demo preparation:
  - Example contracts with tests
  - Deployment script
  - Walkthrough documentation
- [ ] README.md:
  - Quickstart guide
  - Feature overview
  - Contribution guidelines
- [ ] Pitch materials:
  - Value proposition
  - Architecture diagram
  - Roadmap (post-MVP features)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MVP Limitations
- Only supports Sepolia & Anvil networks
- Basic GitHub Actions integration
- Minimal dashboard functionality
- No multi-chain support
- No advanced access control

### Future Considerations
- Support for additional networks
- Multi-chain deployment
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics
- Gas optimization suggestions
